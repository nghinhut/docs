**Identity management (IdM), also known as identity and access management (IAM or IdAM), is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources.**

<!--more-->

IdM systems fall under the overarching umbrella of IT security and Data Management. 
Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access. 
Identity and Access Management solutions have become more prevalent and critical in recent years as regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex.
It addresses the need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous technology environments and to meet increasingly rigorous compliance requirements.

## Searching problem
Searching on encrypted data is needed more extra steps.
Choose the wrong approach may lead you to spend more resource to encrypt/decrypt data while not maintain a good performance.

### Blind indexing
This is the best approach I can find, for now.

#### Create blind index table


#### Query blind index table
